## Overview

The `CalculationExample` contract showcases three mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, and division. It provides an example of using various Solidity control structures to validate inputs and handle errors. The contract includes detailed comments to explain the purpose and behavior of each function.

## Functions

### `add`

The `add` function takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the operands to be added together. It uses the `require` statement to validate that both operands are greater than zero before performing the addition. The result is stored in the `result` variable.

### `subtract`

The `subtract` function also takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the operands for subtraction. It uses the `assert` statement to ensure that `a` is greater than or equal to `b` before performing the subtraction. The result is stored in the `result` variable.

### `divide`

The `divide` function accepts two input parameters, `a` (dividend) and `b` (divisor). It uses the `revert` statement to handle the case where the divisor is zero, preventing division by zero. The result of the division operation is stored in the `result` variable.

## Error Handling

The contract employs different error handling techniques for various scenarios:

- The `add` function uses `require` to validate that both input operands are greater than zero.
- The `subtract` function uses `assert` to ensure that the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand.
- The `divide` function uses `revert` to prevent division by zero.
